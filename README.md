# The Technicalities of Reproducibility - Jupyter Exercise

This is a Jupyter exercise, part of the "The technicalities of reproducibility" learning unit, of the learning path ["Technical skills are the bridge to reproducible research. An introduction for data librarians."](https://github.com/Task-4-2/Technical-Skills-as-bridge-to-reproducible-research). The materials have been developed within work package 4.2 of the [Skills4EOSC project](https://www.skills4eosc.eu/). More detailed information about the learning path is available in the [corresponding Git book](https://task-4-2.github.io/Technical-Skills-as-bridge-to-reproducible-research/latest/).

## Exercise Description

This exercise introduces the participants to the basic concepts of the Jupyter notebooks, one of the most popular virtual lab notebook formats today. It guides the participant through the process of using an online service to open an existing notebook, execute its code, and modify it according to set out requirements.

## Instructions

### Scenario Setup

A paper that you have been reading has linked to a GitHub repository where among other things a Jupyter notebook is included. Using this notebook the authors have analyzed the underlying raw data and drawn the conclusions outlined in the paper. You are interested to see if re-executing the Jupyter notebook indeed leads to the results discussed by the authors. You would also like to answer some additional questions, thus a slight altering of the notebook is also needed.

### Tasks Assigned to Participants

Open the [jupyter-example.ipynb](./jupyter-example.ipynb) notebook using one of the following ways:

- Using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/korvoj/jupyter-notebook-example/blob/master/jupyter-example.ipynb), free, but requires a Google Account
- Using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/korvoj/jupyter-notebook-example/HEAD?labpath=jupyter-example.ipynb), free, no sign up is required
- Using an institutional Jupyter notebook server or any other third-party service providing Jupyter notebook hosting

Execute all code cells of the notebook and try to understand what the Jupyter notebook is analyzing.

Modify the Jupyter notebook, so that instead of analyzing records related to `Reproducibility Crisis`, it analyzes records related to `open science` in general.
